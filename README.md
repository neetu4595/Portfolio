## Projects
### Credit Card Fraudulent Transaction Prediction
[Project](https://github.com/neetu4595/Portfolio_Projects/blob/main/Credit_Card_Fraudulent_Transaction.ipynb)

Developed a predictive modeling solution within the context of credit card transaction security, utilizing binary classification techniques to distinguish between fraudulent and legitimate transactions. The model was constructed based on comprehensive data spanning from January 2019 to December 2020 in the United States. Employing advanced data analysis techniques and leveraging the Python programming language, specifically implementing Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) models, the project aimed to enhance fraud detection capabilities in the financial domain. This endeavor underscored proficiency in data-driven decision-making, statistical modeling, and programming, contributing to a more robust and secure financial transaction environment.
