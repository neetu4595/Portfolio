## Projects
### Credit Card Fraudulent Transaction Prediction
[Project](https://github.com/neetu4595/Portfolio_Projects/blob/main/Credit_Card_Fraudulent_Transaction.ipynb)

Developed a predictive modeling solution within the context of credit card transaction security, utilizing binary classification techniques to distinguish between fraudulent and legitimate transactions. The model was constructed based on comprehensive data spanning from January 2019 to December 2020 in the United States. Employing advanced data analysis techniques and leveraging the Python programming language, specifically implementing Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) models, the project aimed to enhance fraud detection capabilities in the financial domain. This endeavor underscored proficiency in data-driven decision-making, statistical modeling, and programming, contributing to a more robust and secure financial transaction environment.

In this project our focus is to analyze and visualize the dataset on causes of deaths around the world from 1990 to 2019. Our aim is to extract some important insights about the leading causes of deaths over the past three decades and identify any significant changes in the mortality patterns.The dataset on “Causes of Deaths around the World” has been taken from the ‘Kaggle’ website. The dataset has a total of 34 columns and 6121 rows, including the headers which were later converted into a pivot with 8 rows using tableau prep for the convenience of visualization. It contains the data of 204 countries from the year 1990 to the year 2019. It has 31 different causes of deaths including diseases, accidents, and natural disasters.
