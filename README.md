# Neetu Kumari - Data-driven Business Analyst Graduate

## About Me
Hello there! I'm Neetu, a recent graduate of a Business Analyst course from Cape Breton University, Canada, and holds a master's degree in Mathematics. I specialize in data analytics, using tools like Python, R, SQL, Excel, SPSS, and Tableau to collect and analyze data for informed business decisions.

My portfolio showcases various projects, including dashboards and reports created with Tableau, and Excel. These projects highlight my skills in clear and visually appealing data presentation, making insights easily understandable for decision-makers.

I've also worked on programming projects in Python, SQL, R and SPSS, demonstrating my ability to extract valuable insights from complex datasets and integrate data from multiple sources.

In addition to my experience in Data Analysis, I have conducted a project titled "A Comparative Study on Diffusion Models for Tabular Data Synthesis in Healthcare." I also had the opportunity to present the corresponding poster at an AI Symposium held at Dalhousie University in Canada.

Beyond technical skills, I bring a strategic mindset to data analysis, emphasizing critical thinking and problem-solving. I believe my experience makes me an ideal candidate for any data analyst role. I'd love the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further with you. For further details about my professional background and to connect, please find me on [LinkedIn(https://www.linkedin.com/in/neetu1995/). Thanks for checking out my portfolio!

## Projects and Academic Paper
### Poster on A Comparative Study on Diffusion Models for Tabular Data Synthesis in Healthcare
[Poster]()

This research conducts a comparative analysis of two advanced diffusion generative models, TabDDPM and TabSyn. The study assesses the quality of synthetic tabular data generated by each model based on three key criteria: similarity evaluation, utility evaluation, and privacy preservation. The primary aim of this research is to determine which model produces higher quality synthetic tabular data.

### Credit Card Fraudulent Transaction Prediction
[Project](https://github.com/neetu4595/Portfolio_Projects/blob/main/Credit_Card_Fraudulent_Transaction.ipynb)

Developed a predictive modeling solution within the context of credit card transaction security, utilizing binary classification techniques to distinguish between fraudulent and legitimate transactions. The model was constructed based on comprehensive data spanning from January 2019 to December 2020 in the United States. Employing advanced data analysis techniques and leveraging the Python programming language, specifically implementing Logistic Regression and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) models, the project aimed to enhance fraud detection capabilities in the financial domain. This endeavor underscored proficiency in data-driven decision-making, statistical modeling, and programming, contributing to a more robust and secure financial transaction environment.

### Causes of Death Around the World
[Project](https://github.com/neetu4595/Portfolio_Projects/blob/main/Causes_of_death_around_world.twbx)

In this project our focus is to analyze and visualize the dataset on causes of deaths around the world from 1990 to 2019. Our aim is to extract some important insights about the leading causes of deaths over the past three decades and identify any significant changes in the mortality patterns.The dataset on “Causes of Deaths around the World” has been taken from the ‘Kaggle’ website. The dataset has a total of 34 columns and 6121 rows, including the headers which were later converted into a pivot with 8 rows using tableau prep for the convenience of visualization. It contains the data of 204 countries from the year 1990 to the year 2019. It has 31 different causes of deaths including diseases, accidents, and natural disasters.

### The Factors Influencing the happiness of people Around the World
[Report](https://github.com/neetu4595/Portfolio_Projects/blob/main/World%20Happiness%20Project.pdf)

Our goal in this project is to analyze “Happiness and Corruption 2015-2020” data in Kaggle and to find the factors affecting global people in their happiness level, their levels of influence and to know in what way corruption affects the World Happiness Score.
